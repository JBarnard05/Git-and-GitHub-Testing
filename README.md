# Git-and-GitHub-Testing
This project will be used to test Git and GitHub features and codes in order to practice new skills. After completing the "Learning Git and GitHub" course on LinkedIn I will be implementing and testing what I have learnt in this project. 

This project will contain an "index.html" HTML file that will be updated in a new branch and merged back into the main branch, a template was found at: https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/ . This was used to setup this HTML file.

A "rename.md" textfile was created to practice renaming files.

A ".gitignore" file was created with this repository using the "Node" template on GitHub, however I have added "notes/" to the end the file in order to list my own files that I want Git to ignore. I have added a "ignorefile.md" textfile in my notes folder to test the gitignore feature, this file contains my personal notes reflecting on my understanding of the gitignore feature.
