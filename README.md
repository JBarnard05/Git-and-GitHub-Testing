# Git-and-GitHub-Testing
This project will be used to test Git and GitHub features and codes in order to practice new skills. After completing the "Learning Git and GitHub" course on LinkedIn I will be implementing and testing what I have learnt in this project. 
This project will contain an "index.html" html file that will be updated, as well as a "rename.md" textfile that will be used to practice renaming files.
